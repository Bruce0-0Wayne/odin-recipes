        # <u>Description</u>
    </h2>

    <p>

        Paneer Tikka is a luscious and creamy Indian dish that tantalizes the taste buds with its rich flavors and
        velvety
        texture. Succulent paneer pieces are marinated in a mixture of cream (malai), yogurt, and a blend of aromatic
        spices
        such as cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This marinade imparts a luxurious and mildly spiced profile to the dish.
        After
        marination, the paneer is typically grilled or cooked in a tandoor, resulting in a smoky char that enhances the
        overall
        experience. The creaminess of malai, combined with the aromatic spices, creates a harmonious blend of savory and
        mildly
        sweet notes. Garnished with fresh coriander and served with naan or rice, Paneer Tikka stands out as a
        delightful
        example of Indian cuisine, offering a satisfying and indulgent dining experience.
