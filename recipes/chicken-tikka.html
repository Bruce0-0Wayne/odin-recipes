        # <u>Description</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Chicken tikka is a delectable Indian dish renowned for its vibrant flavors and aromatic appeal. Tender chunks of
        chicken
        are marinated in a rich blend of yogurt and spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. This
        infusion ensures a harmonious balance of savory, tangy, and subtly spicy notes. The marinated chicken is then
        skewered
        and grilled to perfection, creating a tantalizing char and smoky essence. The result is a symphony of textures,
        with the
        exterior boasting a flavorful crust while the interior remains succulent and juicy. Often served with mint
        chutney or
        yogurt sauce, chicken tikka is a favorite appetizer or main course, celebrated for its ability to deliver an
        authentic
        taste of Indian cuisine. Its popularity extends globally, making it a beloved dish that showcases the culinary
        richness
        of Indian gastronomy.
